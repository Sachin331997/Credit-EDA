# Credit EDA
  Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of credit-related datasets to uncover patterns and insights.

  In this Project, we're diving into how banks and finance companies use data to make smarter lending decisions. Imagine you work for a company that lends money to people in cities. Sometimes, it's tough to decide who to lend to because some folks don't have a good track record of paying back loans.

We're going to look at a bunch of data to figure out who's likely to pay back their loans and who might not. If we get it wrong, the company could lose money. So, we're going to use a technique called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study patterns in the data and help the company make better decisions.

We're focusing on two main risks:

Losing Business: If we turn down someone who would have paid back the loan, we lose out on making money.
Losing Money: If we lend to someone who won't pay back, we lose money.
The data we have shows us different situations:

Some people struggle to make payments on time.
Others pay on time without any issues.
When someone applies for a loan, there are four things that could happen:

We say yes and approve the loan.
The person changes their mind or we decide it's too risky, so we cancel the application.
We reject the application because it doesn't meet our standards.
The person cancels the application during the process.
Our goal here is to use the data to spot warning signs that someone might not be able to pay back their loan. This way, we can make better decisions like saying no to risky applicants or adjusting the loan terms to be safer. Ultimately, we want to understand what factors make someone more likely to default on their loan payments.

We'll dig into the data and look for clues on who might struggle to pay back their loans. This will help the company make smarter decisions and reduce the chances of losing money.
